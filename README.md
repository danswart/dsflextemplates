<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->


A template package that allows you to recall pre-configured .Rmd dashboards from the RStudio "New R Markdown" or "New Flexdashboard" dialog
Use dsflextemplates to start a working example flexdashboard skeleton with my preferred structure for dashboards that read csv files, populate UI sorting inputs based on column names and content of rows.
